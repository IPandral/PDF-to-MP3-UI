# PDF-to-MP3-UI

This repository contains the PDF-to-MP3 Converter application with a user interface (UI). It allows users to convert the text content of PDF files into spoken MP3 audio files. This version provides a graphical interface for ease of use, as an alternative to the [command-line version](https://github.com/IPandral/PDF-to-MP3-CLI).

The tool is designed to aid individuals who prefer auditory learning or those who may have visual impairments, as well as professionals who wish to listen to content while engaged in other activities.

## How it Works

The application offers a straightforward UI where users can:

1. Select a PDF file through a file dialog.
2. Choose an output directory where the MP3 and text files will be saved.
3. Click "Convert" to initiate the conversion process.

Upon completion, the application will automatically open the output folder, displaying the newly created MP3 file and its corresponding text transcript.

We are pleased to announce that PDF-to-MP3-UI now supports macOS!
